# Robot Control Panel Web Page

This is a simple web page for controlling a robot using buttons to move it in different directions.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `web.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the button click events.

## How It Works

- The webpage consists of buttons for moving the robot: Up, Down, Left, Right, and Stop.
- When a button is clicked, the `move` function is called, which logs the direction to the console.

## Usage

1. Open https://reemaalzhrani.github.io/RobotControlPanel-/ in a web browser.
2. Click the buttons to control the robot's movement.
